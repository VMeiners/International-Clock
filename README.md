# Chada Tech Clocks 

**Project Overview**
The Chada Tech Clocks program is a C++ application designed to display the current time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats simultaneously. It aligns with international time standards (ISO 8601) to better serve both domestic and international clients.

**Functional Requirements**
- 12-hour clock displays time in hh:mm:ss AM/PM format (e.g., 02:30:45 PM).
- 24-hour clock displays time in HH:mm:ss format (e.g., 14:30:45).

Both clocks display side-by-side (or stacked if side-by-side isnâ€™t feasible) with the current time.

**Users can interact through a menu to:**
- Add one hour to both clocks.
- Add one minute to both clocks.
- Add one second to both clocks.
- Exit the program.

**How to Use**
- Run the program.
- Input the starting time by entering hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Use the menu to update the time by adding an hour, minute, or second, or exit the program.
- After each update, both clocks will display the current time in their respective formats.
